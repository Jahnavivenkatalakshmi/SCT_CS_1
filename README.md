Description of the Caesar Cipher Program

The Caesar Cipher Program is a simple yet effective tool for encrypting and decrypting text using the classic Caesar cipher algorithm. 
This program allows users to securely encode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions, making it a fun introduction to cryptography.

 Features:
⦁	  Encryption and Decryption**: Users can choose to either encrypt a plain text message or decrypt an encoded message.
⦁	  Custom Shift Value**: The program allows users to input a shift value between 1 and 25, determining how many positions each letter in the message will be shifted.
⦁	  User -Friendly Interface**: The program prompts users for their choices and inputs, making it easy to use even for those unfamiliar with programming or cryptography.

How It Works:
1.Input: The user is prompted to select whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message. They then enter the message and the desired shift value.
2.Processing: 
⦁	For encryption, each letter in the message is shifted forward in the alphabet by the specified shift value. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
⦁	For decryption, the program shifts the letters backward by the same shift value to retrieve the original message.
3.Output: The program displays the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.

Example Usage:
⦁	Encrypting: If a user inputs the message "Hello, World!" with a shift of 3, the program will output "Khoor, Zruog!".
⦁	Decrypting: If the user then inputs "Khoor, Zruog!" with the same shift of 3, the program will return to the original message "Hello, World!".

⦁	This program serves as an educational tool for understanding basic encryption techniques and can be easily modified or expanded for more advanced cryptographic applications.
